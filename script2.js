//  data types are categories for values, including: Number, String, Boolean, Object, Array, Null, Undefined, and Symbol. These data types determine the type of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it.

// Primitive data types in JavaScript are simple data types that hold a single value. They are:

// Number: for representing numerical values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
// String: for representing sequences of characters, such as words or phrases.
// Boolean: for representing true or false values.
// Null: for representing a deliberate non-value.
// Undefined: for representing an uninitialized or missing value.
// Symbol: for representing unique and immutable values.
// You would use primitive data types when you want to store simple values that don't have properties or methods. For example, you might use a Number to represent a quantity, a String to represent a name, or a Boolean to represent a true/false condition. Primitive data types are also preferred when performance is important, as they are stored directly in memory and do not require the overhead of an object.
